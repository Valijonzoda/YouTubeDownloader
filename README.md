# Youtube-Playlist-Downloader

A Simple Python application with GUI designed to download mp3 or mp4 from a Youtube playlist



# Instructions

1.) Add videos in a playlist  
2.) Copy playlist link and paste on the input  
3.) Select path  
4.) Download MP3 or MP4  
5.) Wait for download to finish  


# Notes

* This app serves as a convenience purpose for downloading multiple free-to-use Youtube mp3/mp4 (free sfx, vfx, etc.)
* It is catered more to downloading MP3 from Youtube since the MP4 is set to download the highest resolution which makes it slow to download if the video has more than 1080p resolution (could add resolution options if needed).
* Make sure the executable file is at the same directory as the icon and png.
* Downloading copyrighted material is illegal and I'm not responsible for any copyright issues.
